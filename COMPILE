Requirements
============
A suitable OS (WinXP or higher, OSX, Linux, or similar).

CMake 3.0 or higher.

Qt (5.6 and 5.7 are confirmed to be compatible).

(Optional) A reasonably recent version of Git.
	If you do have Git then configuring will need an extra flag.
	The flag is -DDISABLE_GIT_REVISION=1 and an example is in this file.

	For Windows you should checkout either
		https://git-scm.com/downloads
		or
		https://git-for-windows.github.io/

	Windows XP does not seem to support Git(-for-windows) anymore:
		https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/FAQ#which-versions-of-windows-are-supported

If on OSX you'll need Xcode.

On Windows you'll need a development environment. That means:
	MinGW that is compatible with CMake.

	or

	Visual Studio.
		Version 2015 is confirmed to be compatible.
		Versions 2012 and 2013 should work too.
		Versions 2010 and earler might not work.

On Linux (or similar) you'll need:
	A C++11 supported compiler (GCC or clang is recommended).
	X11/Xorg development headers.
	libXtst-devel (maybe? and might not be named this)



How to configure and compile Synergy 101 !!
-------------------------------------------

	mkdir build
	cd build

Now decide what build-type you're going to use. Options are:
	Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.
For the instructions we're going to shorten it to <BT>.

Now back to configuring. You should be in the 'build' directory here.

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<BT> ../

If you did not install Git then you'll need to add a flag here:

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<BT> -DDISABLE_GIT_REVISION=1 ../

If you're using Windows and Visual Studio then you'll need a generator too.
For example I use the following for VS2015 x64 builds:

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<BT> -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ../

Removing the "Win64" at the end defaults to x32 builds.
Other Visual Studio versions that might be supported are:
"Visual Studio 8 2005", "Visual Studio 9 2008", "Visual Studio 10 2010",
"Visual Studio 11 2012", "Visual Studio 12 2013" and "Visual Studio 15 2017".


<TODO: Add MinGW stuff here.>


Finally to build Synergy. You need to be in the 'build' directory.

	cmake --build ./

If your cmake uses `make` internally then you can do this for multi-core builds:

	cmake --build ./ -- -j5

And if you're Visual Studio then you'll need to do:

	cmake --build ./ --config <BT>



That's it. Synergy binaries should now be in the "build/bin/<BT>" directory.
With Windows it'll put it in the "build\bin\<ARCH>\<BT>" directory where
<ARCH> is either x64 or Win32 for x64 or x32 builds respectively.
