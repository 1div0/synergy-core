How to configure and compile Synergy 101 !!

	mkdir build
	cd build

Now decide what build-type you're going to use. Options are:
	Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.
For the instructions we're going to shorten it to <BT>.

Now back to configuring. You should be in the 'build' directory here.

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<BT> ../

If you're using Windows and Visual Studio then you'll need a generator too.
For example I use the following for VS2015 x64 builds:

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<BT> -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ../

Removing the "Win64" at the end defaults to x32 builds.
Other Visual Studio versions that might be supported are:
"Visual Studio 8 2005", "Visual Studio 9 2008", "Visual Studio 10 2010",
"Visual Studio 11 2012", "Visual Studio 12 2013" and "Visual Studio 15 2017".


<TODO: Add mingw stuff here.>


Finally to build Synergy. You need to be in the 'build' directory.

	cmake --build ./

If your cmake uses `make` internally then you can do this for multi-core builds:

	cmake --build ./ -- -j5

And if you're Visual Studio then you'll need to do:

	cmake --build ./ --config <BT>



That's it. Synergy binaries should now be in the "build/bin/<BT>" directory.
With Windows it'll put it in the "build\bin\<ARCH>\<BT>" directory where
<ARCH> is either x64 or Win32 for x64 or x32 builds respectively.
